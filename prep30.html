Input domains are the data you are allowed to use and output ranges are the range of output values you can put, displayed in pixal units. This is useful for data visualization. These are helpful for data visualizations because they can make data put to scale for visualtions. An example of this is using sizing down graphs to scale, so graphs do not become unmanageable. In addition to this Scales can also be ordinal. This can use nonqualitiative values for outputs, and can quantify nonqualitiative values. This is useful for data visualizations because using scales, people can make data visualizations with and without
