            .transition was a large part of what made these cool animated graphs. This method creates a transition between two graphs so that people can see the differences and similarities between them. There was also a hover function where if you hover over a graph and it changes in value and cover, which was an integral part of the graph. Another cool thing dr. B used was event listeners, which changed the SVG in his code.
